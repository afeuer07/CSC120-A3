I worked with Aimen on this assignment in the beginning, we worked out a lot of syntax and technical stuff together to get started. (Including getting Java properly installed and setting up the basics like the constructor.)

We attended the homework session that replaced class on Thursday morning which was helpful. I learned about the potential scanner bug (of not throwing out the newline) before I had a chance to run into it which was nice. 

I like working in Java! I learned it my senior year of high school in AP Comp Sci A so it feels very familiar, although I have forgotten a lot of the details since its been two years. Regardless I am finding it much easier than Python because I never learned Python at all and even though its supposed to be relatively easy, I was having a hard time with it for A2. 

Based on the teeny bit of Python I've been exposed to, it definitely has less particular syntax like not requring curly braces and semicolons, and not requiring you to declare variable types. In general though it seems like object oriented programming is pretty widely useful so it's nice that Java is set up for that. But I guess I think that because I haven't programmed much that would have been better in Python because of the classes I've taken...

Once I got Java installed and had the basic parts of the program set up (and rembered how to write in Java) this went very smoothly. Getting the number of rounds and canned responses working wasn't bad at all, and figuring out how to optimize the respond method was fun. I used ChatGPT to help me fix some issues in the repond method- asking it for hints but not full code is very helpful. Here's the conversation: https://chatgpt.com/share/67af9c62-82e8-8012-a7ad-8c092ae08a1d . I've changed the code a decent amount since then though.

It's hard for me to make a recommendation for someone else because they'd be completely learning Java on this assignment which I wasn't (for the most part), but I would tell people to do the warmup exercises to get started! I also found it helpful to have a list of Java's String methods up to figure out what I could use for the respond method.
